# kintone-subliminal-plug-in

## Overview
The kintone subliminal plug-in is a plug-in that displays images in your kintone App for a split second, at given intervals.
It is a plug-in to test out subliminal image effects.
It does not guarantee subliminal image effects to the user. Although, we do hope it does.
